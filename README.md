# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Jerry Onyemuru
'''I am a Data Scientist, transitioned from a Quality, Health, Safety and Environment (QHSE) field with over 8 years of experience. I was able to transition into Data Science by undergoing a Data Science and Machine Learning training through a collaborative effort between the MIT and Great Learning Academy.'''
- ðŸ”­ So far, I have understudied many used cases and conducted four projects with three of the four on my own while the fourth, collaboratively.
- ðŸ¤” I am currently looking for recommendation systems projects that would encourage collaboration to improve on my skills and learn some more.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
